```calculus```  focuses on basic MATLAB operation skills like contour plot, visualization.

```linearMath``` focuses on basic matrix operations in MATLAB.

```computationalFoudations``` focuses on basic numerical methods, like fixed point iteration method, Newton-Raphson method, application for chaos and contraction, RK4, and a problem about forest management.
